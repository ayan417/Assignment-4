        <p>Turkey,officially the Republic of Türkiye, is a country mainly located in Anatolia in West Asia, with
            a relatively small part called East Thrace in Southeast Europe. It borders the Black Sea to the north;
            Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and
            the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria to the west. Turkey is home to over 85 million people;most are
            ethnic Turks, while ethnic Kurds are the largest ethnic minority.Officially a secular state, Turkey has
            a Muslim-majority population. Ankara is Turkey's capital and second-largest city. Istanbul is its largest
            city and economic center. Other major cities include İzmir, Bursa, and Antalya.</p>
        <p>First inhabited by modern humans during the Late Paleolithic, present-day Turkey was home to various ancient
            peoples.The Hattians were assimilated by the Hittites and other Anatolian peoples. Classical Anatolia
            transitioned into cultural Hellenization after Alexander the Great's conquests, and later Romanization
            during the Roman and Byzantine eras. The Seljuk Turks began migrating into Anatolia in the 11th century,
            starting the Turkification process.The Seljuk Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in
            1243, when it disintegrated into Turkish principalities.Beginning in 1299, the Ottomans united the
            principalities and expanded. Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in 1453. During the
            reigns of Selim I and Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power. From 1789 onwards,
            the empire saw major changes, reforms, centralization, and rising nationalism while its territory declined.

        <p>In the 19th and early 20th centuries, persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction and in the
            Russian Empire resulted in large-scale loss of life and mass migration into modern-day Turkey from the
            Balkans, Caucasus, and Crimea. Under the control of the Three Pashas, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I
            in 1914, during which the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian
            subjects.Following Ottoman defeat, the Turkish War of Independence resulted in the abolition of the
            sultanate and the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne. Turkey emerged as a more homogenous nation state.The
            Republic was proclaimed on 29 October 1923, modelled on the reforms initiated by the country's first
            president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Turkey remained neutral during most of World War II, but was involved in
            the Korean War. Several military interventions interfered with the transition to a multi-party system.</p>
        <p>Turkey is an upper-middle-income and emerging country; its economy is the world's 16th-largest by nominal and
            12th-largest by PPP-adjusted GDP. As the 15th-largest electricity producer in the world, Turkey aims to
            become a hub for regional energy transportation. It is a unitary presidential republic. Turkey is a founding
            member of the OECD, G20, and Organization of Turkic States. With a geopolitically significant location,
            Turkey is a NATO member and has its second-largest military force. It may be recognized as an emerging, a
            middle, and a regional power. As an EU candidate, Turkey is part of the EU Customs Union.</p>
        <p>Turkey has coastal plains, a high central plateau, and various mountain ranges; its climate is temperate with
            harsher conditions in the interior. Home to three biodiversity hotspots, Turkey is prone to frequent
            earthquakes and is highly vulnerable to climate change.Turkey has a universal healthcare system, growing
            access to education, and increasing levels of innovativeness.It is a leading TV content exporter.With
            numerous UNESCO World Heritage sites and intangible cultural heritage inscriptions, and a rich and diverse
            cuisine, Turkey is the fifth most visited country in the world.</p>
